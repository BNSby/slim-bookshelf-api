# Slim Bookshelf API

This is the First party web application.

It:

* allows the user to log into the API via the "password" grant system and so
the user enters their username/password to gain access.

* allows the user to authorise a 3rd party application to have access via the 
  OAuth2 authorisation code grant. 


Run this app:

    $ cd web;
    $ php -S 0.0.0.0:8889 -t public/

and navigate to http://localhost:8889/
